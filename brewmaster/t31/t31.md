2p and 4p Charred Dreams (ChD) damage show as a single spell.
2p ChD healing emits (healing) events. 4p Guard emits Buff Apply and Buff Remove events.

Do keep in mind that a lot of this behaviour, especially how much damage it deals, is INCREDIBLY broken against target dummies. Don't compare breakdowns/total damage dealt on target dummies. It's always been a bad thing to do.

2p ChD Damage:
- Triggers from BoF hit, DFB Hit. (Not BoF DOT).
- Damage dealt is `trigger damage * 0.2` to the target that was hit by the trigger damage.

2p ChD Healing:
- Triggered by BoF Hit, DFB Hit, EK Hit, EK Proc, ChP. (Not BoF DOT)
- Triggered a second time by ChP for a sometimes-incorrect amount (magnitude depends on where you are, it's correct in at least some instances and incorrect in the open world).
- Healing dealt is `trigger damage * 0.5 * ( 1 + GotC%) * (1 + CtH%)`.

4p ChD Damage:
- Triggers from every Monk/BrM source of damage **except** BDB, ChD, BoF DOT, Chi Surge, CJL, EotT.
- Damage dealt is `trigger damage * 0.1` to the target that was hit by the trigger damage.
- BDB procs from ChD damage.
- Estimated 50% proc chance.

4p Guard:
- Accumulates 2p/4p ChD damage. (only viable source to accumulate that exists)
- When solo, accumulator is accurate. When multiple players exist, accumulator is incorrect. Unknown root cause.
- Capped at your maximum HP.
- Absorb is scaled by neither Crit (via CF) nor Vers.
- If a stagger-add is fully absorbed, it essentially did not occur for the context of tick/pool recalculations.
- Accumulator likely persists indefinitely (through death, relog very probably) util consumed by CB usage.

Image notes:
- \* Not all effects referenced as DRs apply at this stage. It's complicated, some are weird, others straight up lie and fit in at the Absorb step.
- Totally not at all similar to a previous image. Praise bird lady.
