**State of Sims**
- A new apl for 10.2 has been published.
- Provides notably better support for all sorts of atypical talent combinations (such as PtA), and minor improvements for common configurations.
- The T31 profile has been published.
- T31 tier is implemented and accurate as of my latest reverification.

UPDATE 11/11
- An additional T31 profile has been published for some different talent configurations.
- ~~Trinket nerfs have yet to be applied.~~
- ~~T31 tier buffs have yet to be applied.~~
- Damage intake for 10.2 will be configured when the appropriate data from live exists (and I gain access to it).

UPDATE 11/14
- Trinket nerfs are in spell data from Blizzard. Some potential issues, but they're reported.
- ~~T31 tier buffs are *not* in spell data from Blizzard. I have applied it temporarily as a hotfix in simc, pending further communication, but they are expected to be in this week's build.~~
- Damage intake still pending.
- Tier reverification will also be required, ideally early this week. If you have 4p *and then raid more* this week and can share logs, please feel free to @ them to me in <#408364223840649226>.

If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, feel free to ping me in <#408364223840649226> or file an issue [on the simc GitHub repository](https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/issues). Simc is always under active development and very much appreciates all contributions.
