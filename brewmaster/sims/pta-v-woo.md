**PtA v WoO in Sims**

Over the last few weeks, some improvements were cooked up to both the non-PtA and PtA APLs (as that's how they're split up) for 10.2.

Non-PtA gained a very small amount of dps through a minor optimization with EK usage, and a potentially very large amount of dps, depending on damage intake from Improved Invoke Niuzao.

PtA gained a substantial amount of dps in most target counts, in no small part allowed due to no longer using the 10.1 4p and the Leverage effect. As a result, PtA's APL complexity increased TREMENDOUSLY, albeit is still within what I would consider to be humanly executable.

As a result, **you must consider both Improved Invoke Niuzao AND PtA results with a healthy grain of salt** if you cannot guarantee you can play at that high of a level. Very few or no players will be executing those playstyles to the level required to get the simed value, and will fall far, far short. This has been the case for the entirety of PtA's lifespan so far, and will likely only grow worse in 10.2.

Non-PtA, non-Improved Invoke Niuzao configurations will remain my recommendation for players for the forseeable future.
