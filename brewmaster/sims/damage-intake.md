**Damage Intake in Sims**

There have been several recent discussions w.r.t the impact of damage intake on our sims in the past few days in <#408364223840649226> and other places. Currently, you will notice that we perform *quite poorly* in sims, in no small part due to the damage intake not being bumped up for 10.2 at this time.

I am waiting for live data to accurately increase these values so they are representative of this patch. To help tide people over, I have prepared two different T31 profiles, but these come with issues, as they are not one-size-fits-all.

<@125866541253263360> and I ran into this *lovely* situation where independent attempts to create T31 profiles with different damage intake values diverged into two dramatically different results, even when considering non-Improved Invoke Niuzao talent configurations, which even more dramatically warps this situation.

BiS is *heavily* impacted by damage intake, which is both difficult to model and varies heavily on content. Be aware of this when making choices that may seem unusual, especially equipping haste, which may be suggested at specific (higher) damage intake volumes, if you specify custom configurations.

Much like content style, accessible gear and group configurations, damage intake is a very important factor that I hope to work to improve modeling of in the future, but for the past while and likely forseeable future, I'll do my best to provide us some *sane* defaults that are applicable to many but not all players.
